These are my personal AdGuard lists. You are free to use them any way you like. Please give credit where it is due.

1. Duplicates removed
2. If both `||site.example.com^` and `||example.com^` exist the former is removed.
3. Entries containing a tld that is in the [tld source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/adblock/spam-tlds.txt) are removed. For this reason the tld source should be added to your blocklists.

Sources are listed [here](https://github.com/dd900/AdGuard-Lists/tree/master/Sources).

I tend to block a lot and whitelist as needed.
Lists are **usually** updated every 8 hours.
