! Please help to collect domains!
! It could occur that the TV fails to receive new updates, or that other apps or services no longer work. Please report such an incident.

[Adblock Plus 3.4]
! Title: ðŸŽ® Game Console Adblock List
! Version: 25February2021v1-Alpha
! Expires: 4 days
! Description: Much like there's now lists for AdGuard Home and Pi-hole to block ads on smart-TVs, here's an attempt from me at doing the same for videogame consoles with AdGuard Home. Enjoy.
! Important note: To block ads in the consoles' dedicated internet browsers with AdGuard Home, and not in the system menus, check out https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/AdGuard%20Home%20Compilation%20List/AdGuardHomeCompilationList.txt instead.
! For more information, details, helpful tools, and other lists that I've made, visit https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Wiki/General-info.md#english

! â€”â€”â€” PlayStation 3 â€”â€”â€”
! Ads
||nsx-e.np.dl.playstation.net^
! What's New
||mercury.dl.playstation.net^
! PlayStation Store Preview, incl. 'My Channels' logos
||nsx.np.dl.playstation.net^
! Ticker ads in the XMB clockbar
||adproxy.ndmdhs.com^

! â€”â€”â€” Nintendo 3DS â€”â€”â€”
! Blocks the "Theme Shop", with the intention of preventing the annoying pink dot in the upper left of the Home Menu from reappearing all the time.
! WARNING: The "Theme Shop" should be visited once to remove the pink dot, and only then should this list be subscribed to.
||npdl.cdn.nintendowifi.net^

! â€”â€”â€” Wii U â€”â€”â€”
! Believed to reduce the initial loading time of Wii Sports Club by several seconds
! Since no third-party Miiverse clients with console support are believed to be able to exist by now (January 2020), this entry is pretty much here to stay.
||discovery.olv.nintendo.net^

! â€”â€”â€” Xbox One â€”â€”â€”
! Removes sponsored info slots in the system menu
! https://new.reddit.com/r/pihole/comments/act023/psa_block_the_sponsored_banner_ad_on_the_xbox_one/
! Note that this also blocks Perks from Xbox Game Pass if you are subscribed to that (https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/pull/162).
||arc.msn.com^$ctag=~device_pc|~os_windows

! â€”â€”â€” Xbox 360 â€”â€”â€”
! Removes paid advertising on the Xbox Live Dashboard
! https://www.ign.com/wikis/xbox-360/Block_Ads_on_Xbox_Live
||rad.msn.com^

! â€”â€”â€” Nintendo Switch â€”â€”â€”
! There is a system setting for getting rid of the Nintendo eShop advertisements on the lockscreen, which is hidden in System Settings â†’ System â†’ News Channel Settings â†’ Nintendo News â†’ Unfollow.
! The following entries gives access on demand to the web browser, as per SwitchBru's DNS server trick (https://www.switchbru.com/dns/), while also making it possible to use AdGuard Home for adblocking at the same time. However, since SwitchBru uses a trick to make the Switch think it's partway into logging on to a hotel network, the entries would reject access to all other Switch web activities while the entries are live:
!!! 45.55.142.122 ctest.cdn.nintendo.net
!!! 127.0.0.1 receive-lp1.er.srv.nintendo.net
!!! 127.0.0.1 aauth-lp1.ndas.srv.nintendo.net

! â€”â€”â€” Nintendo DS / Wii â€”â€”â€”
! For a largely official list to connect to Wiimmfi (for DS games only) and RiiConnect24, check out https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RiiConnect24/DNS-Server/master/dns_zones-hosts.txt

! â€”â€”â€” PlayStation 5 â€”â€”â€”
! I offer a â‚¬10 bounty to anyone who know how to either turn off the Explore menu tab, or prevent the Explore tab from loading any content, payable by PayPal.

! â€”â€”â€” PlayStation 4 â€”â€”â€”
! There is a system setting for getting rid of homescreen "Buy Now"-type ads, which is hidden in Settings â†’ System â†’ Automatic Downloads â†’ Featured Content â†’ Off.

! â€”â€”â€” PlayStation 2 â€”â€”â€”
! I am not personally aware of any Free McBoot homebrew apps that can connect to external domains, let alone unintentionally.
! There were multiple third-party online game servers for the PS2, of which Bobz Entertainment and OpenSpy are the only ones with some functionality still working.
! Any IP redirection entries for those two servers would've excluded one another; plus it appears that griefing was/is a very huge concern among the PS2 modding community, which I can vaguely presume is why they haven't openly revealed their DNS-server-side IP redirections.

! â€”â€”â€” Xbox Series â€”â€”â€”
! I offer a â‚¬10 bounty to anyone who know how to remove the sponsored ads in the main menu, payable by PayPal.

! â€”â€”â€” Dreamcast â€”â€”â€”
! Although I have become aware of the existence of Dreamcast Live, I can't find the IP address redirections used by their DNS server.

! â€”â€”â€” Steam Machines / SteamOS / Steam â€”â€”â€”
! To get rid of popup windows that promote new games in desktop mode, go to View â†’ Settings â†’ Interface â†’ "Notify me about additions or changes to my games, new releases, and upcoming releases."

! â€”â€”â€” Epic Games Store â€”â€”â€”
! To remove system notifications that promote new games and sales, go to Settings â†’ Desktop notifications, and turn off "Show News and Special Offer Notifications" and optionally "Show Free Game Notifications"

! â€”â€”â€” Other consoles â€”â€”â€”
! Entry suggestions on GitHub would be much appreciated. Especially for portable PlayStation consoles and Sega Saturn, as I don't own any of them.
